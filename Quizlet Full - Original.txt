Riser Clamps on Standpipes are required...

Riser clamps on standpipes are required in several specific locations within multistory buildings according to building codes and fire safety standards like NFPA 13 and 14. Here's a breakdown of where they are essential:
At every floor penetration: This refers to wherever the standpipe goes through a concrete floor slab between stories. The clamp helps distribute the weight of the pipe to the building structure effectively.
At the lowest level of the building: This provides a secure anchor point for the entire standpipe system at the base.
At the top of the standpipe: This ensures stability and prevents movement at the highest point of the system.
At alternate floors in between: Clamps are needed at regular intervals throughout the height of the building, typically on every other floor, to maintain stability and prevent sagging.
Above and below offsets: If the standpipe needs to change direction horizontally (offset), clamps are required on both sides of the bend to manage the additional stress on the pipe at that point.
In essence, riser clamps are required throughout a multistory building at any point where the standpipe needs support to maintain its position and withstand its weight.


Heads in trash chute...

Head enclosures for trash chutes are not typically required by building codes. However, sprinkler heads are required in trash chutes for fire safety reasons.
Here's a breakdown:
Head enclosures: These are not mandated. Trash chutes have openings on each floor for depositing waste, and these openings would make it difficult to install a head enclosure that allows for easy trash disposal.
Sprinkler heads: These are required. Building codes and fire safety standards, like NFPA 13, mandate sprinkler systems in trash chutes. These typically include at least one sprinkler head at the top of the chute and additional heads at alternate floors and the bottom terminal room. The sprinkler heads are recessed and protected to prevent them from being damaged by falling debris.
