# Fire Protection Standards Study Guide

A comprehensive, scripted dataset of questions and answers for studying fire protection standards, primarily sourced from NFPA codes. This project cleans, enhances, and formats study materials for various applications like Quizlet and Google's NotebookLM.

---

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Dataset**: A large collection of Q&A pairs covering critical fire protection topics.
- **Standardized Sources**: Each entry is linked to a specific code section, with sources formatted as `Authority: [Name], Document: [Title], Section: [Number]`.
- **Automated Processing**: Python scripts to clean, verify, and enhance the dataset for consistency and accuracy.
- **Multiple Formats**: Data is available in raw, cleaned, and enhanced JSON, plus text formats optimized for different study platforms.
- **Unique IDs**: Every Q&A pair has a unique `id` for easy referencing.
- **Granular Tagging**: A hierarchical tagging system (e.g., `Piping-Materials`, `System-Components`) allows for more precise content filtering.
- **Structured Answers**: Complex answers with lists or key-value pairs are automatically converted into structured JSON objects for easier programmatic access.

## Project Structure and Data Flow

The project revolves around taking a raw JSON dataset and processing it through a series of scripts to produce clean, enhanced, and usable study guides. This workflow is visualized below:

### File Descriptions

#### üóÇÔ∏è Data Files

-   **`Quizlet Full - Original.json`**: The raw, unprocessed data. Contains potential duplicates and formatting inconsistencies.
-   **`Quizlet Full - Original.txt`**: The raw, unprocessed data in plain text format.
-   **`Quizlet Full - Verified.json`**: The cleaned version of the data, with duplicates removed.
-   **`Quizlet Full - Enhanced.json`**: The most advanced dataset. Includes a unique `id`, standardized `source`, granular `tags`, and structured `answer` fields.
-   **`Quizlet Full - FormattedForImport.txt`**: A text version of the data, formatted for direct import into Quizlet.
-   **`Quizlet Full - NotebookLM.txt`**: A plain text version of the enhanced data, specifically formatted for use as a source in Google's NotebookLM.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Python Scripts

-   **`process_json.py`**: Reads `Quizlet Full - Original.json`, removes duplicate questions, and saves the result as `Quizlet Full - Verified.json`.
-   **`enhance_json.py`**: Takes the verified data, adds detailed `tags` and `source` fields to each entry, and applies Markdown formatting. Saves the result as `Quizlet Full - Enhanced.json`.
-   **`convert_to_notebooklm.py`**: Converts the final enhanced JSON into the `Quizlet Full - NotebookLM.txt` format.
-   **`format_quizlet.py`**: Formats the verified JSON data into a tab-separated text file (`Quizlet Full - FormattedForImport.txt`) suitable for Quizlet import.

#### üìÑ Documentation

-   **`JSON Analysis.md`**: A detailed report on the structure, integrity, and quality of the JSON data, including suggestions for improvement.
-   **`NotebookLM Mind Map.pdf` / `.png`**: Visual diagram of the project's file structure and data flow.
-   **`NotebookLM Audio Overview.wav`**: An audio recording providing an overview of the project's integration with Google's NotebookLM.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x

### Usage

To regenerate the processed files from the original data, run the scripts in the following order.

1.  **Clean the original data:**
    This script creates the `Quizlet Full - Verified.json` file.
    ```bash
    python process_json.py
    ```

2.  **Enhance the cleaned data:**
    This script uses the verified file to create the `Quizlet Full - Enhanced.json` file.
    ```bash
    python enhance_json.py
    ```

3.  **Convert for NotebookLM:**
    This script creates the `Quizlet Full - NotebookLM.txt` file from the enhanced data.
    ```bash
    python convert_to_notebooklm.py
    ```

4.  **Format for Quizlet:**
    This script creates the `Quizlet Full - FormattedForImport.txt` file from the verified data.
    ```bash
    python format_quizlet.py
    ```
